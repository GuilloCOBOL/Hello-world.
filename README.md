# Hello-world.
 
My name is Guillermo Ruiz.
In the past, I worked for three diferent big companies in Mexico, as a system developer
using IBM mainframes and COBOL. After that, I was trying some business and then I came to the USA in 2003 and since then I have had no relationship with mainframes or COBOL. That is why I am interested in taking the IBM COBOL course, to dust off my language skills and participate either as a volunteer or being hired by a company to develop or maintain COBOL systems.
